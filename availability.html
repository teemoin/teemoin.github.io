	<b>AVAILABILITY</b>
   </p>

   <p>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The worldwide releases of these consoles actually vary depending on the region which is a very 
	weird decision as they happen to be the most hyped up pieces of tech every 6-7 years. So, you would 
	expect they will be released everywhere right? Well, the world just doesn’t work like that sadly, 
	and reality is often disappointing.

   <p>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The PS5 gets released almost everywhere and it is no exception here in Malaysia. Sony just recently 
	released the price of the PS5 as of the time this was written and they are actually very reasonable, 
	even though they are a bit more expensive compared to if you bought them in US Dollars. There are two 
	versions of the PS5, which are the normal version and retails for RM 2,299 and the Digital Edition 
	which is the cheaper between the two which retails at RM 1,869. 
   </p>


   <p>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The difference between the two is basically just the Digital Edition doesn’t have a disk drive. With 
	that being said, Malaysians will have to wait a little while as it is still in pre order phase and it 
	is expected that the locals will be able to get their hands on the system on the 11th of December 2020 
	nationwide in selected retail stores. Though, people need to be on edge and make sure they order it 
	early as these things are very popular and are selling like hotcakes. 
   </p>



   <p>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As for the Xbox Series-X, it is not making any official releases here in Malaysia and Microsoft is not 
	planning to do so any time soon. Unlike Sony, the Xbox is not really focusing on the Asian markets and 
	is only releasing in selected markets only which is a major bummer. To be honest, this is something that 
	is expected and is seen coming as previous generations of the Xbox never did release in Malaysia for some 
	odd reason. With all this in mind, I still hoped that they would change things up this time around, but 
	I guess they didn’t bother at all. 
   </p>


   <p>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is a shame as the Xbox is a powerful device and could really take off here in the Malaysian market as 
	they would provide competition to the currently dominating Sony PlayStation. If Malaysians really want 
	the latest Xbox, then they would have to import it from another country and luckily, they can get it from 
	our neighbours, which is Singapore as it is released officially there.

   <p>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is noted that Xbox also released two versions of their consoles which is the Series-X and the 
	Series-S. The X is the flagship and has all the bells and whistles while the S is the less powerful 
	version of the X while also being a little cheaper. The Series-X is $699 SGD and the Series-S is $459 SGD 
	which is roughly RM 2,130 and RM 1,400 respectively when converted.
   </p>


   <p>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In conclusion, these consoles are very competitive as with every new generational release have been 
	before this and it is no different this time around. For which either one you go for, you will have 
	a great experience regardless. The only thing that poses a problem is availability. Sony has no problems 
	and it is only the Xbox’s side of things is a bit of a lengthy process if you ever want to get it anyway. 
	Setting all things aside, our discussion and comparison ends here and I hope that you found this article to 
	be helpful in choosing your next gaming console to put in your living room. Everything from here onwards is 
	up to you to decide, and the ultimate question is, which side are you on?
